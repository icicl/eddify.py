# eddify.py
make code less confusing by renaming all the variables to be more uniform (replaces as much code as possible with underscores, *maybe* makes it more confusing instead...)<br />Inspired by my friend who complains about my use of one-letter variables, so I decided to start using 0-letter variables.

both `eddify.py` and `eddify_.py` work the same; `eddify_.py` has simply been processed by this script as an example of the output -- the script writes the output to a file with the name of the original followed by an underscore.

only works on python for now :(
